    <p>he club isn't the best place to find a lover
        So the bar is where I go
        Me and my friends at the table doing shots
        drinking fast and then we talk slow
        you come over and start up a conversation
        with just me and trust me
        I'll give it a chance now
        Take my hand stop, put van the man
        on the jukebox and then we start to dance
        And now I'm singing like
        Girl you know I want your love
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
        </p>
